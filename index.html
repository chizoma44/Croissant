          Waking up to a warm pastry and a hot cup of coffee or tea is one of
          life’s simple pleasures. There’s nothing like it. Except maybe when
          it’s filled with chocolate! Breaking apart freshly made croissants,
          watching the steam escape is just something you won’t get from
          anything store-bought! Ok maybe at a fancy bakery or local cafe, but
          if you’re ready to learn all the tips and tricks in your own kitchen,
          stick with me!
